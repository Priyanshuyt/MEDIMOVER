**Problem Statemenr**
In 2014, a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola while caring
for repatriated patients, highlighting the risks healthcare
workers face despite protective measures. Similarly,
during the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, numerous
healthcare workers in Toronto became infected due to
inadequate protective equipment and training. These
incidents underscore the critical need to minimize staff
exposure in contaminated areas to prevent occupational
infections.
